Description: When plotting treated-minus-control differences, after-minus-before changes, or difference-in-differences, the ttrans() function symmetrically transforms the positive and negative tails to aid plotting.  The package includes an observational study with three control groups and an unaffected outcome; see Rosenbaum (2022) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2022.2063944>.
